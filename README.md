# SlashGaming Diablo II CPU Sleep Patch
A universal and configurable CPU sleep patch for Diablo II.

## How to Use
Use a program to inject the DLL file into Game.exe.

## Configuration
A configuration file should be created in the same directory as the DLL file when the program first injects. From there, you may configure the number of milliseconds the game will sleep on every frame in order to save CPU cycles. If the number is too low, the game will hog more CPU cycles. If the number is too high, the game will stutter. If running SGBH, you may refresh the configuration file.
